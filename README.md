Create a simple GUI application in python for converting units of mass/weight (Google Code-in 2014)(High School Project))


Create a simple GUI application in python for converting unit of 'Mass' from one system of units to another. For example pound to kilogram, atomic mass unit to kilogram etc...

You can use python GUI tools like Tkinter, GTK or wxPython.  (I used wxPthon)
   In the application one should be able to easily convert  mass/weight measurements such as kilogram to pound or atomic mass unit.

   User should  select units for conversion (To and From) and enter the value of mass and click on convert button to get the converted value.
